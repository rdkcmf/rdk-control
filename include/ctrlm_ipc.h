/// @mainpage Control Manager IARM Interface
/// This document describes the interfaces that Control Manager uses to communicate with other components in the system.  It exposes
/// functionality to other processes in the system via the IARM bus. The IARM interface provides inter-process communication via Calls
/// and Events.  Control Manager supports one or more network devices via a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).  The HAL API specifies the
/// method by which a network device communicates with the Control Manager.
///

/// Initialization
/// --------------
///
/// During initialization, the Control Manager initializes the IARM bus by calling IARM_Bus_Init() using its well known bus name, CTRLM_MAIN_IARM_BUS_NAME.
/// Upon successful initialization, the Control Manager connects to the bus by calling IARM_Bus_Connect().\n
///  If initialization is not completed successfully, the process will sleep for X seconds and retry the initialization procedure.
///
/// For debug purposes, the Control Manager may register to receive log messages from the IARM bus calling the IARM_Bus_RegisterForLog() function.
///
/// Termination
/// -----------
///
/// Before the Control Manager exits, it unregisters for events, disconnects from the IARM bus and terminates the session by calling IARM_Bus_UnRegisterEventHandler(), IARM_Bus_Disconnect()
/// and IARM_Bus_Term() respectively.
///
/// Normal Operation
/// ----------------
///
/// After successful initialization, the Control Manager will begin processing and generating @link CTRLM_IPC_MAIN_EVENTS events @endlink and @link CTRLM_IPC_MAIN_CALLS remote process calls @endlink (RPC).  Periodically, the status of the IARM bus connection is
/// checked by calling IARM_Bus_IsConnected().  If the result is not IARM_RESULT_SUCCESS, the Control Manager will return to the pre-initialized state.

/// @brief Macros for constant values used by Control Manager clients
/// @details The Control Manager API provides macros for some parameters which may change in the future.  Clients should use
/// these names to allow the client code to function correctly if the values change.
