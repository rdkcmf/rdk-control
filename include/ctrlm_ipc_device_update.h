/// @brief Broadcast Events accessible via IARM bus
/// @details The IARM bus uses events to broadcast information to interested clients. An event is sent separately to each client. There are no return values for an event and no
/// guarantee that a client will receive the event.  Each event has a different argument structure according to the information being transferred to the clients.  The events that the
/// Device Update component in Control Manager generates and subscribes to are detailed below.

/// Event Generation (Broadcast)
/// ----------------------------
///
/// The Device Update component generates events that can be received by other processes connected to the IARM bus. The following events
/// are registered during initialization:
///
/// | Bus Name                 | Event Name                                       | Argument                                             | Description |
/// | :-------                 | :---------                                       | :-------                                             | :---------- |
/// | CTRLM_MAIN_IARM_BUS_NAME | CTRLM_DEVICE_UPDATE_IARM_EVENT_READY_TO_DOWNLOAD | ctrlm_device_update_iarm_event_ready_to_download_t * | Generated when an update is detected for a device. |
/// | CTRLM_MAIN_IARM_BUS_NAME | CTRLM_DEVICE_UPDATE_IARM_EVENT_DOWNLOAD_STATUS   | ctrlm_device_update_iarm_event_download_status_t *   | Generated at 0 and 100 percent and each time a download percent increment is reached. |
/// | CTRLM_MAIN_IARM_BUS_NAME | CTRLM_DEVICE_UPDATE_IARM_EVENT_LOAD_BEGIN        | ctrlm_device_update_iarm_event_load_begin_t *        | Generated when a device begins to load an image |
/// | CTRLM_MAIN_IARM_BUS_NAME | CTRLM_DEVICE_UPDATE_IARM_EVENT_LOAD_END          | ctrlm_device_update_iarm_event_load_end_t *          | Generated when a device completes loading an image |
///
/// IARM events are available on a subscription basis. In order to receive an event, a client must explicitly register to receive the event by calling
/// IARM_Bus_RegisterEventHandler() with the bus name, event name and a @link IARM_EventHandler_t handler function@endlink. Events may be generated at any time by the
/// Device Update component. All events are asynchronous.
///
/// Examples:
///
/// Register for a Device Update event:
///
///     IARM_Result_t result;
///
///     result = IARM_Bus_RegisterEventHandler(CTRLM_MAIN_IARM_BUS_NAME, CTRLM_DEVICE_UPDATE_IARM_EVENT_DOWNLOAD_STATUS, download_status_handler_func);
///     if(IARM_RESULT_SUCCESS == result) {
